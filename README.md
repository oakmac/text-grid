# Text Grid

This is an experiment to build a text-editor grid component using web
technologies.

**NOTE:** It is unlikely that this project will result in anything useful. I
just wanted to play around with an idea some. You have been warned ;)

```sh
# compile CLJS files
lein cljsbuild once

# start local webserver
